## LRC Architects Website

Recently started this project which came in handy with the new NextJS app router. This website is very image heavy and I had to use a lot of image optimization for Next Images. I am using Sanity as my backend which integrates very nicely with NextJS.

I used image loading and displaying a blurred version of the image while it is loading. I also used tailwind css which works great with Next Server components. In the proccess of making this i learned a lot about Next Images and html images in general. Images are a huge part of the web it fells upon developers to how to optimally serve them without breaking the quality.
