## Authentication with trpc Express

For years I've been thinking authentication of an application is a very complicated task. But when i looked into it it became simple and very much understandable to an average programmer. I try to explain how i achieved this authentication flow. Nowadays people go for thirparty libraries and services for the auth solution but building this helped me to grasp some important concepts behind the scenes.

### Technology Stack

- **trpc express: ** for the server handling the routing and end to end type safety.
- **mongodb: ** as the database for saving users.
- **redis: ** for storing and retrieving the JWT tokens.
- **docker: ** for spin up the database and app servers.

The code is pretty much self explanatory. You can check source code in [here](https://github.com/AslamJM/fullstack-trpc-project/tree/main/server)
