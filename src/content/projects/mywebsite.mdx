## This Exact Website

I'm desprate. I wanted to share something with the world. I've been active on Twitter and consume lot of Youtube and I wanted to share my thoughts of the stuff i learned and built. I figured a website is better way to go. I build this on NEXTJS 13's app directory which is easy and fun to work with.

I've been in coding and web development over 4 years. I never had the good website on my own. I started my journey with wordpress and felt in love with react. I also worked in gatsby framework for a site project and I didn't like its syntax.

I was hesitent with **NEXT JS** first. with the release of **NEXT 13** and its app router i realise its an awsesome framework for react. I wanted to make my personal site with it.
